## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in **Computer Engineering** at the **University of Sydney**, supervised by **Prof. Philip Leong**. My research lies at the intersection of **Computer Architecture** and **Machine Learning**, with a focus on designing energy-efficient FPGA accelerators for Deep Neural Networks. 

Previously, I received my Master's degree from **Peking University**, where I focused on machine vision and automated diagnostic systems.

## Research Interests
- **Hardware Acceleration:** FPGA-based AI training and inference.
- **Computer Arithmetic:** Low-precision Block Minifloat, MX formats, and numerical stability.
- **Deep Learning:** Time-series forecasting and industrial machine vision.

## Education
- **Ph.D. in Computer Engineering**, University of Sydney, 2019 — 2025
- **M.S. in Electronics**, Peking University, 2013 — 2017
- **B.S. in Electrical Engineering**, ECUST, 2009 — 2013

## Teaching
I have served as a Tutor for several courses at USYD:
- **ELEC1601:** Introduction to Computer Systems
- **ELEC3607:** Embedded System
- **ELEC3608:** Computer Architecture
- **ELEC5405:** Building Microchips: From Theory to Practice
- **MTRX3700:** Mechatronics 3
